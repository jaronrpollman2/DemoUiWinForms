The intent of this program is to make a UI that would reduce the access to the entire windows desktop.
I created it to ensure that a user would only be allowed to explore folders that are in a predesignated
location without allowing movement into those directories that would allow changing of windows settings.
It is by no means an all inclusive solution and is intended to accompany other user account modifications.
One thing that would be required to ensure that the user couldn't access the desktop would be to also exclude the
use of the task manager. To do this it would require registry edits for the user account.
